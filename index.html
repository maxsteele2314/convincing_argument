  <h1>
    Success for All
  </h1>
  <p>
   Even when I first returned to my cause, Success For All, I wasn't for sure as to why I wrote it but after some recollection I remember
    my goal. With this being said I believe one misconception of my causse is that it has no actaul meaning. It is to broad and not
    narrowed enough for anyone to gain any real substance from it's words or get to know me any better. It definietly is broad but that
    is by design giving me enough room to truly express what I care about and drive for. The first component is bringing success to my 
    current family as well as my future family. Both my dad and mom worked extremely hard to get me and my siblings that they didnt
    neccessarily have. They were always decent off but the chance to go to a school such as Centre without debt wasn't possible so I 
    expect myself to live up to that standard. Secondly success for myself wether thats financially, mentally or whatever. On the outside
    i'm typically seen as almost lazy or not driven it's not true at all. While I will admit sometimes I slack when I feel defeated I
    otherwise am completly devoted to anything I commit to and always have been. Really after my somewhat cold outside inside I truly do 
    care about what I do with myself and how i'm percieved so being successful for myelf is important in this aspect. Finally Success for
    everyone else while not neccessarily being computer science related i'm a very caring person. I dont always show it especially since 
    Iv'e started college but actaully I love listening to others and helping them in any way shape or form that I can. So whether that's 
    advice, just need soemone to listen, or actually need help and I then see these people succeed in the immediate future it is one of my
    favorite things. So while sometimes class beats me down and I can't just memorize as in the past I still drive to bring success for all 
    in every which way I have stated above.
